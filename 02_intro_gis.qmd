Mimic Data Carpentry with local campus data

-   Flush out what we want the end product to look like

Annotation vs geospatial data

Types of data:

-   Vector: Difference between point, line, and polygon
-   Raster: an array of values that can be used
    -   Single band
    -   Multibands

Projections? Reprojection (raster, polygons) 

- Import point data from a csv 
- Zonal statistics (simple)

Add raster with another projection

- NCOS? Bird observations (might becsv) 
- Topographic map to compute solar panels location (maybe workshop 3?) 
- Facilities data (buildings) 
- DEM 
- Bike paths
- Trees

Potential simple analysis as end product 

- Zonal statistics 
- Count number of points within a polygon 
- Heatmap from points 
- Buffering

Exporting data from GIS 

- Shapefile 
- geodatabase

What tool? 

- ArcGIS online 
- ArcGIS pro 
- QGIS

## Introduction to ArcGIS online

We will need to provide a tour of the interface and the different apps. We can keep how to add a layer for later

## Concepts of a map

-   Basemap (background)
-   Layers (you add on top of the basemap)
-   Symbology & legend

Optional for online maps?

-   Scale
-   Orientation (North oriented is the default)
-   Grid - Lat/Long

## I want to draw a shape on a map

### Choose a basemap

-   Topography
-   Satellite

### Draw a polygon around campus

-   Make a new map

-   Add a sketch

-   Make sure to choose polygon

-   Save your map (please use our naming convention!)

### how - too

## But is a shape data?

-   Add an observation to our [cognitive borders of campus map](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/webeditor/index.html?appid=a5e83ae370d64d528aacb3bf27885d05)
-   See previous observations on [the results map](https://arcg.is/11Ca9n1)

## Features have attributes

-   a data table
-   columns have fixed data types (a lot of them)
-   for example bikes

## Play with symbology & transparency

Based on data `street_pavement`

1.  Make a new map
2.  Choose a basemap
3.  Add layer from Contents --\> Groups --\> From Maps to Analysis
4.  Create filter to show only bikepaths
5.  Join 2 filters together to *OR* sidewalks
6.  Save your work!

## Sharing your map

-   Online
-   Exporting to other formats (image, PDF)

## More tools

non-Esri tools:

-   Google Maps and Earth (maybe short demo of this?)

-   MapBox

-   OpenStreetMaps

-   CalTopo

-   R ← but that’s programming

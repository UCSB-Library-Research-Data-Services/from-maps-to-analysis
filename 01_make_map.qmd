The goal of this lesson is to demonstrate how to make a simple map, suitable for inclusion in a publication, using ArcGIS Online. We will follow the typical workflow of starting with a basemap, adding feature layers from external sources, drawing annotations on top of the map, and finally, preparing the map for presentation and exporting it. As an exercise, you will be creating a map that reflects your personal experience biking on the UCSB campus.

As we will discuss at the end of this lesson, there are many ways of making such a map without using a GIS tool. In fact, in many cases GIS is overkill, both because most of the features GIS tools provide will not be used and because the GIS interface can be cumbersome. But an advantage of GIS is that it opens up the possibility of treating map elements as data, and that in turn opens up and provides an introduction to the world of spatial analysis.

## Introduction to ArcGIS Online

A brief tour of the interface and the different apps.

### Log on to ArcGIS Online

<https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

Single-sign on with your UCSB NetID to access the licensed features. You may need to enter the url "ucsb" into the space. It is entered below.\
Do not use the ArcGIS Login. This is for users who do NOT have a UCSB Net ID.

![](images/arcgis-login.png){width=40% fig-align="center"}

Click "Continue" and enter your UCSB NetID credentials. You should have a similar landing page indicating that you are using the ArcGIS online under the UCSB license. You may need to authenticate with DUO on your phone.

### Tour of the interface

The main organization page lists the campus administrative contacts and open data groups available on campus. You can also see the latest content published by users on your campus.

Along the top of the page, is the main tool bar. 

![](images/main-menu-bar.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

- **Home** will take you to the main landing page when you first sign in.
- The **Gallery** lists content created by UCSB users which is viewable to everyone (with permissions)
- **Groups** are a list of groups which you can create or join. Some are invitation only. These are popular when you are working in group projects. 
- **Content** is where your created or uploaded content is listed. You can make folders in here to organize your layers and features. 
- **Notebooks** is ESRI's version of a Jupyterhub-like environment. You can use ArcPy here. This may not be available to you based on your user role.
- **Organization** will take you back to our main page. This is not the same as Home. 
- **Scene**, or **Scene Viewer** is where you can create 3D GIS scenes, such as neighborhood models and digital twins. 
- **Map**, or **Map Viewer** is where you can create 2D maps. ***We will be focusing on using the Map Viewer for this workshop.***


Next to your campus profile, is a "meatball" menu with a drop-down menu of the Esri Apps. There are many tools here, but for the context of this workshop, we will be focusing on ArcGIS Online and the Map Viewer.

### The Map Viewer

Navigate to "Map" on your top menu bar and open a new map.


![](images/map_viewer.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

## Map main components

In the Map Viewer there is a menu bar in the left column. This is where you can add items to your map. Here are the basic elements of building a map:

-  Basemap (background)
-  Layers (you add on top of the basemap)
-  Symbology & legend

It is also recommended to add additional map elements to ease the interpretation of a map, such as a title, text and labels, directional information (e.g. North arrow), a scale bar, and a graticule (think coordinate system).

### Basemap

The first item that is already added to the map is the foundational basemap. This basemap cannot be altered and is static. You can move its location, but its features such as roads and buildings (if any) cannot be changed. 

You can change the basemap in the Map Viewer. Go to "Basemap" in the menu column. These maps have been pre-selected as appropriate foundational basemaps. 

![](images/current-basemap.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}


Make sure you choose a basemap that is easy to follow and is a good reference. The current basemap layer is **Topographic**. 

### Feature layers

With our example, you can also add it as a layer. 
When you add an item to your map, it will show up under your Layers. When you want to see the layer properties, you can either use the menu on the right hand column to view its properties or use the "..." next to the layer to open the same panel.

# UCSB bike infrastructure map 


**TO DO**: Add an image of the final map here


## Step 1: Add layers to a basemap

With that introduction, you now have the opportunity to start creating your own map. The goal here is to create a map of the bike infrastructure on campus and to then annotate on top of that some of your personal experience as a bicyclist or pedestrian on campus.

Start by opening a new map in the [Map Viewer](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html).

### Import vector layer (bike paths)

From the **Layers** panel, click on the add layer button and select `My groups` from the dropdown menu. The content from all the groups you belong to will be listed here. Select the group `From Maps to Analysis` if you have too many groups to find it easily.

![Drop down menu to My Groups](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-layer-group.png){width=40%}

Look for the feature layer `osm_cycleways` and click on the `+ Add` button to add it to your map.

![Add UCSB cycleways layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-feature-line-layer.png){width=90%}

### Import point layer (bike racks)

Repeat the above steps to add the feature layer `bike_racks_ucsb` to your map.

![Add UCSB bike racks layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-feature-point-layer.png){width=90%}

### Import polygon layer (buildings)

Now look for the feature layer `UCSB Campus Buildings` and add it to your map.

![Add UCSB buildings layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-feature-polygon-layer.png){width=90%}

### Save your map

Now that you have added the layers to your map, save it by looking for the folder icon in the left menu bar and then selecting the `Save as` option. 

![](images/Workshop1/Step1/save-as.png){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

In there, you can add a title, tags, and a short description of your map.


## Step 2: Customize symbology & transparency

After adding our three layers, we have some work to do to make the map more readable. First, let's adjust the symbology of the bike racks layer to reduce its size and change its symbol to a bike icon.

- Click on the layer `bike_racks_ucsb` to open its properties panel.
- On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
- Look for the `② Pick a style` option and select `Style options`.
- Click on the pencil icon next to `Symbol style` to open the symbol selector.

There, we have multiple options to customize the symbol. Let's click on the current symbol chevron to open the full symbol gallery.

From the menu, we can select several categories of symbols. Let's select the `Government` category and look for a bike parking icon. Click on the `Done` button to apply the changes and return to the symbol style panel. 

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-select-symbol.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

To change the size of the symbol, we can use the `Size` slider to reduce it to a more appropriate size. In this case, we're using 5.68 px. Also, select "Adjust size automatically" if you want the symbols to scale as you zoom in and out of the map.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-point-size.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}


### Adjust style based on attribute

Now, what if we wanted to adjust the symbology based on an attribute? Let's say we wanted to fill each building with a different color based on its use (academic, residential, administrative, etc.). We can do that by changing the style of the `UCSB Campus Buildings` layer.

- Click on the layer `UCSB Campus Buildings` to open its properties panel.
- On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
- Look for the `① Choose attributes` option and select `+ Field`.
- Select the attribute `b_use`, which stands for building use, and click on `Add`.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-by-attribute.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

As a result, you will see that the buildings are now filled with different colors based on their use. You can further customize the colors by clicking on the color ramp and selecting a different one.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-by-attribute-result.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

### Adjust layer transparency based on attribute

Finally, let's say we wanted to adjust the transparency of cycleways based on the max speed allowed on each bike path. We can do that by changing the style of the `osm_cycleways` layer.

- Click on the layer `osm_cycleways` to open its properties panel.
- On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
- Look for the `② Pick a style` option and select `Style options`.
- Open the panel `Transparency by attribute` and switch the toggle to set the transparency based on attribute values.
- Select the attribute `maxspeed`.

As a result, you will see that the bike paths are now more transparent for higher speed limits and less transparent for lower speed limits.

To increase the visibility of the bike paths, we can increase the width of the lines by editing the `Width` slider on the `Symbol style` panel. We selected 3.75 px for this example.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-transparency-by-attribute.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

Here is the final result of our symbology adjustments:

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-final-result.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

## Step 3: Annotate the map

In addition to bringing external sources of information into a map (whether in the form of a basemap or additional feature layers), it is common to want to add new information. In many cases it is better to think of the new information as data, and to store it in its own feature layer. We will be describing this approach in the next workshop. For our purposes here, though, we will take the more straightforward approach of simply drawing on the map. The hand-drawn features will appear in what ArcGIS Online calls a "sketch layer."

- Draw points where you were in a (near-)accident on a bike path, either as bicyclist of pedestrian.
- Draw a line where you think there should be a bike path but isn't.
- Draw a circle where you think there should be a bike parking lot but isn't.

## Step 4: Prepare the map for publication

Almost there! At this point you're ready to start packaging your map for publication.

- Add a title
- Add a legend
- Add a scale bar (optional)

## Step 5: Share your map

-  Online
-  Exporting to other formats (PNG, PDF)

## Other appoaches

There are many ways of making a simple map. Here are some alternative approaches.

-  By screen grabbing: Create a base layer by screen grabbing a source map displayed in a web browser window (e.g., Google Maps). Then, using a drawing tool (a dedicated drawing tool such as Adobe Illustrator, or any program that provides drawing tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint), import the screen grab and draw on top of that. \[The following is probably too detailed...] It is possible to capture the base layer at higher-than-screen resolution by zooming in, panning and screen grabbing it in pieces, and merging the pieces using a tool like Adobe Photoshop. And by measuring distances between known points, and/or carefully keeping track of scale, it is possible to accurately position figures and annotations.

-  Google Earth

-  MapBox

-  OpenStreetMaps

-  [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com) comes with a variety of base layers, including multiple types of topographic maps, and it provides a number of drawing and annotation tools. Certain features may require a subscription.

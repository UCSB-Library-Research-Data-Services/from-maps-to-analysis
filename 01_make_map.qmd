## Log on to ArcGIS

<https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

Single-sign on with your UCSB NetID to access the licensed features. You may need to enter the url "ucsb" into the space. It is entered below.\
Do not use the ArcGIS Login. This is for users who do NOT have a UCSB Net ID.

Click "Continue" and enter your UCSB NetID credentials. You should have a similar landing page indicating that you are using the ArcGIS online under the UCSB license. You may need to authenticate with DUO on your phone.

## Introduction to ArcGIS online

We will need to provide a tour of the interface and the different apps. We can keep how to add a layer for later

The main organization page lists the campus administrative contacts and open data groups available on campus. You can also see the latest content published by users on your campus.

Along the top of the page, is the main tool bar. 

![](images/main-menu-bar.png)

- Home will take you to the main landing page when you first sign in.
- The Gallery lists content created by UCSB users which is viewable to everyone (with permissions)
- Groups are a list of groups which you can create or join. Some are invitation only. These are popular when you are working in group projects.  
- Content is where your created or uploaded content is listed. You can make folders in here to organize your layers and features. 
- Notebooks is ESRI's version of a Jupyterhub-like environment. You can use ArcPy here. This may not be available to you based on your user role.
- Organization will take you back to our main page. This is not the same as Home. 
- Scene, or Scene Viewer is where you can create 3D GIS scenes, such as neighborhood models and digital twins. 
- Map, or Map Viewer is where you can create 2D maps. *We will be focusing on using the Map Viewer for this workshop.*


Next to your campus profile, is a meatball menu with a drop-down menu of the Esri Apps. There are many tools here, but for the context of this workshop, we will be focusing on ArcGIS Online and the Map Viewer.

## Concepts of a map

-   Basemap (background)
-   Layers (you add on top of the basemap)
-   Symbology & legend



## What are feature layers?
## Features have attributes

-   a data table
-   columns have fixed data types (a lot of them)
-   for example bikes

## Play with symbology & transparency

Based on data `street_pavement`

1. Make a new map
1. Choose a basemap
1. Add layer from Contents --> Groups --> From Maps to Analysis
1. Create filter to show only bikepaths 
1. Join 2 filters together to *OR* sidewalks
1. Save your work!







Optional for online maps?

-   Scale
-   Orientation (North oriented is the default)
-   Grid - Lat/Long

## I want to draw a shape on a map

### Choose a basemap

-   Topography
-   Satellite



### how - too

## But is a shape data?

-   Add an observation to our [cognitive borders of campus map](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/webeditor/index.html?appid=a5e83ae370d64d528aacb3bf27885d05)
-   See previous observations on [the results map](https://arcg.is/11Ca9n1)

## Sharing your map

-   Online
-   Exporting to other formats (image, PDF)

## More tools

non-Esri tools:

-   Google Maps and Earth (maybe short demo of this?)

-   MapBox

-   OpenStreetMaps

-   CalTopo

-   R ← but that’s programming

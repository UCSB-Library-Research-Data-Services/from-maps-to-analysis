## Introduction to ArcGIS online

We will need to provide a tour of the interface and the different apps. We can keep how to add a layer for later 



## Concepts of a map

- Basemap (background)
- Layers (you add on top of the basemap)
- Symbology & legend



## What are feature layers?
## Features have attributes

-   a data table
-   columns have fixed data types (a lot of them)
-   for example bikes

## Play with symbology & transparency

Based on data `street_pavement`

1. Make a new map
1. Choose a basemap
1. Add layer from Contents --> Groups --> From Maps to Analysis
1. Create filter to show only bikepaths 
1. Join 2 filters together to *OR* sidewalks
1. Save your work!







Optional for online maps?

- Scale
- Orientation (North oriented is the default)
- Grid - Lat/Long

## I want to draw a shape on a map

### Choose a basemap

- Topography
- Satellite



### how - too

## But is a shape data?

-   Add an observation to our [cognitive borders of campus map](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/webeditor/index.html?appid=a5e83ae370d64d528aacb3bf27885d05)
-   See previous observations on [the results map](https://arcg.is/11Ca9n1)

title: "I want to make a map"
---

The goal of this lesson is to go through an exercise of making a simple map, suitable for inclusion in a publication, using ArcGIS Online.  We will follow the a typical workflow of starting with a base map, adding feature layers from externals sources, providing our own annotations on top of the map, and finally, preparing the map for presentation and exporting it.

As we will discuss at the end of this lesson, there are many ways of making such a map without using a GIS tool.  In fact, in many cases GIS is an overkill.  But an advantage of GIS is that it opens up the possibility of treating map elements as data, and that opens up the world of spatial analysis.

## Introduction to ArcGIS online

A brief tour of the interface and the different apps. We can keep how to add a layer for later 

## Log on to ArcGIS

<https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

Single-sign on with your UCSB NetID to access the licensed features. You may need to enter the url "ucsb" into the space. It is entered below.\
Do not use the ArcGIS Login. This is for users who do NOT have a UCSB Net ID.

![](images/arcgis-login.png)

Click "Continue" and enter your UCSB NetID credentials. You should have a similar landing page indicating that you are using the ArcGIS online under the UCSB license. You may need to authenticate with DUO on your phone.

The main organization page lists the campus administrative contacts and open data groups available on campus. You can also see the latest content published by users on your campus.

Along the top of the page, is the main tool bar. 

![](images/main-menu-bar.png)

- Home will take you to the main landing page when you first sign in.
- The Gallery lists content created by UCSB users which is viewable to everyone (with permissions)
- Groups are a list of groups which you can create or join. Some are invitation only. These are popular when you are working in group projects.  
- Content is where your created or uploaded content is listed. You can make folders in here to organize your layers and features. 
- Notebooks is ESRI's version of a Jupyterhub-like environment. You can use ArcPy here. This may not be available to you based on your user role.
- Organization will take you back to our main page. This is not the same as Home. 
- Scene, or Scene Viewer is where you can create 3D GIS scenes, such as neighborhood models and digital twins. 
- Map, or Map Viewer is where you can create 2D maps. *We will be focusing on using the Map Viewer for this workshop.*


Next to your campus profile, is a meatball menu with a drop-down menu of the Esri Apps. There are many tools here, but for the context of this workshop, we will be focusing on ArcGIS Online and the Map Viewer.

## The Map Viewer
Navigate to "Map" on your top menu bar and open a new map.

## Concepts of a map

In the Map Viewer there is a menu bar in the left column. This is where you can add items to your map.

-   Basemap (background)
-   Layers (you add on top of the basemap)
-   Symbology & legend

The first item that is already added to the map is the foundational base map. This map cannot be altered and is static. You can move its location, but its features such as roads and buildings (if any) cannot be changed. 

You can change the basemap in the Map Viewer. Go to "Basemap" in the menu column. These maps have been preselected as appropriate foundational basemaps.

You can also manually select a feature layer to use as your basemap. 

It will initially show you "your content" but you can drop down and choose items from other places such as a group or from ucsb. Since you want an authoritative layer to be the basemap, you will want to choose something from the Living Atlas. 

![](images/adding-basemap.png)

Layers in the Living Atlas have been vetted by ESRI and are maintained by organizations. Typically, government entities create and publish items here,such as USGS or NOAA.. 

The bottom example is the National Land Cover Model created and maintained by USGS.

Make sure you choose a basemap that is easy to follow and is a good reference.Searching for the term "basemap" will also query appropriate maps that can be used for this purpose. 

## What are feature layers?

With our example, you can also add it as a layer. 
When you add an item to your map, it will show up under your Layers. When you want to see the layer properties, you can eithr use the menu on the right hand column to view its properties or use the ... next to the layer to open the same panel.

## Features have attributes

-   a data table
-   columns have fixed data types (a lot of them)
-   for example bikes

## Play with symbology & transparency

Based on data `street_pavement`

1. Make a new map
1. Choose a basemap
1. Add layer from Contents --> Groups --> From Maps to Analysis
1. Create filter to show only bikepaths 
1. Join 2 filters together to *OR* sidewalks
1. Save your work!







Optional for online maps?

-   Scale
-   Orientation (North oriented is the default)
-   Grid - Lat/Long

## I want to draw a shape on a map

### Choose a basemap

-   Topography
-   Satellite



### how - too

## But is a shape data?

## Sharing your map

-   Online
-   Exporting to other formats (image, PDF)

## More tools

There are many ways of making a simple map.

-   Use any drawing tool (even PowerPoint), create a base layer by screen grabbing any map source displayed in a web browser (Google Maps or other), and then drawing on top of that.  By keeping track of scale, it is possible to place figures at accurate locations.

-   Google Earth

-   MapBox

-   OpenStreetMaps

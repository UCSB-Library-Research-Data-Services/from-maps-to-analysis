The goal of this lesson is to demonstrate how to make a simple map,
suitable for inclusion in a publication, using ArcGIS Online. We will
follow a typical workflow of: 1 Starting with a basemap, 1 add feature
layers from the UCSB campus, 1 draw annotations on top of the map, 1
preparing the map for presentation and exporting it. As an exercise, you
will be creating a map that reflects your personal experience biking on
the UCSB campus.

We will end up with a map something like this: \# UCSB bike
infrastructure map

**Preliminary**: The below image of the final map is a placehold

(it would be nice if we could put our map into an iframe, but github
doesn't support that)

As we will discuss at the end of this lesson, there are many ways of
making such a map without using a GIS tool. In fact, in many cases GIS
is overkill, both because most of the features GIS tools provide will
not be used and because the GIS interface can be cumbersome. But an
advantage of GIS is that it opens up the possibility of treating map
elements as data, and that in turn opens up and provides an introduction
to the world of spatial analysis.

## Introduction to ArcGIS Online

A brief tour of the interface.

### Log on to ArcGIS Online

[https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com){target="_blank"}

Sign on with your UCSB NetID. You may need to enter "ucsb" into the url
box. Do not use the ArcGIS login! This is for users who do NOT have a
UCSB Net ID.

![](images/arcgis-login.png){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

You should have a similar landing page indicating that you are using the
ArcGIS online under the UCSB license. You may need to authenticate with
DUO on your phone.

### Tour of the user interface

The main organization page lists the campus administrative contacts and
open data groups available on campus. You can also see the latest
content published by users on your campus.

Along the top of the page, is the main tool bar.

![](images/main-menu-bar.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

-   `Home` will take you to the main landing page when you first sign
    in.
-   The `Gallery` contains items from our 'featured content' group
-   `Groups` are a list of groups which you can create or join. Some are
    invitation only. These are popular when you are working in group
    projects. For this workshop, we have created a group called [From
    Maps to
    Analysis](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=92f4de804b2c46eaa70cebc517ecb067#overview){target="_blank"}
    which contains most of the data layers we will be using.
-   `Content` is where your created or uploaded content is listed. You
    can make folders in here to organize your layers and features.
-   `Notebooks` is ESRI's version of a Jupyterhub-like environment. You
    can use ArcPy here. This may not be available to you based on your
    user role.
-   `Organization` will take you back to our main page. This is not the
    same as Home.
-   `Scene`, or `Scene Viewer` is where you can create 3D GIS scenes,
    such as neighborhood models and digital twins.
-   `Map`, or `Map Viewer` is where you can create 2D maps. ***We will
    be focusing on using the Map Viewer for this workshop.***

## The Map Viewer

Open a new, empty map by clicking "Map" on your top menu bar.

![](images/new_empty_map.png){size="50%" fig-align="center"}

### Map main components

In the Map Viewer there is a menu bar in the left column. This is where
you can add items to your map.

-   Basemap (background)
-   Layers (your own or imported from others)
-   Symbology & legend
-   Save and open...

### Basemap

A new map will always open with a basemap. Esri has about 20 different
basemaps available. We will start with the default.

![](images/current-basemap.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

Make sure you choose a basemap that is easy to follow and is a good
reference. The default basemap layer in ArcGIS online is
**Topographic**.

### Save your work often

-   There will be a blue dot until you save
-   Once you save, more options will be available
-   ArcGIS Online **will not auto-save** your map

## Feature layers

When you add an existing layer to your map, it will show up under your
`Layers`. When you want to see the layer properties, you can either use
the menu on the right hand column to view its properties or use the
"..." (we call this a "meatball" menu) next to the layer to open the
same panel.

## Step 1: Add layers to your map

With that introduction, you now have the opportunity to start creating
your own map. The goal here is to create a map of the bike
infrastructure on campus (bike lanes and line, bike racks as points,
buildings as polygons) and to then annotate on top of that some of your
personal experience as a bicyclist or pedestrian on campus.

### Import lines layer (bike paths)

From the **Layers** panel, click on the add layer button. Search
`My organization` for 'UCSB OSM Paths'. There should be only one result.

![Adding a layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/add-a-layer.gif){width="90%"}

### *Challenge* Import points layer (bike racks)

Repeat the above steps to add the feature layer `bike_racks_ucsb` to
your map.

![Add UCSB bike racks
layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-feature-point-layer.png){width="90%"}

### *Challenge* Import via Groups

This time, navigate to the feature layer `UCSB Campus Buildings` by
first finding the "From Maps to Analysis" group.

![Add UCSB buildings
layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/select-feature-polygon-layer.png){width="90%"}

### Reorder layers

After importing the three layers, you'll notice they might not display optimally. There's a GIS convention for layer ordering that helps ensure all features remain visible:

**Layer Order Convention (top to bottom):**

- Points (e.g., bike racks) - should be on top
- Lines (e.g., bike paths) - in the middle  
- Polygons (e.g., buildings) - at the bottom

This ordering ensures that smaller features aren't hidden beneath larger polygon areas.

For our map, the recommended order from top to bottom should be:

1.  `bike_racks_ucsb` (top)
2.  `UCSB OSM Paths` (middle)
3.  `UCSB Campus Buildings` (bottom)

To reorder the layers, click and hold on a layer name in the Layers panel, drag it to the desired position, and release.

![Reorder feature layers](images/Workshop1/Step1/reorder-layers.gif){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

### Accessing the underlying data

One advantage of those \* feature layers \* (are we consistent with our
nomenclature?) is that there is often data associated with it. For
example, if you click on the three dots on the right of a feature layer
you can access their *attribute table* using "Show table".

![attibute table of UCSB buildings
layer](images/Workshop1/Step1/attribute-table.png){width="90%"}

We will see later how you can leverage these attributes to set the
symbology of a layer according to categories or quantities provided by
the attribute table. You can also compute new attributes either based on
other attributes or geospatial information. However this will be for our
second workshop.

### Save early. Save often.

Now that you have added the layers to your map, save it by looking for
the folder icon in the left menu bar and then selecting the `Save as`
option.

![](images/Workshop1/Step1/save-as.png){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

In there, you can add a title, tags, and a short description of your map.

## Step 2: Customize symbology & transparency

After adding our three layers, we have some work to do to make the map
more readable. First, let's adjust the symbology of the bike racks layer
to reduce its size and change its symbol to a bike icon.

-   Click on the layer `bike_racks_ucsb` to open its properties panel.
-   On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
-   Look for the `② Pick a style` option and select `Style options`.
-   Click on the pencil icon next to `Symbol style` to open the symbol
    selector.

There, we have multiple options to customize the symbol. Let's click on
the current symbol chevron to open the full symbol gallery.

From the menu, we can select several categories of symbols. Let's select
the `Government` category and look for a bike parking icon. Click on the
`Done` button to apply the changes and return to the symbol style panel.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-select-symbol.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

To change the size of the symbol, we can use the `Size` slider to reduce
it to a more appropriate size. First, select "Adjust size automatically"
to ensure the symbols to scale as you zoom in and out of the map. Then,
you can use a custom size by moving the slider or entering a value; in
our case, we selected 5.68 px.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true" title="Size slider quirk"}

In ArcGIS Online, every time you select the "Adjust size automatically" option, it will reset the size slider to a default value. So make sure to select your desired size **after** enabling that option.


![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-point-size.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}
:::


### Adjust style based on attribute

Now, what if we wanted to adjust the symbology based on an attribute?
Let's say we wanted to fill each building with a different color based
on its use (academic, residential, administrative, etc.). We can do that
by changing the style of the `UCSB Campus Buildings` layer.

-   Click on the layer `UCSB Campus Buildings` to open its properties
    panel.
-   On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
-   Look for the `① Choose attributes` option and select `+ Field`.
-   Select the attribute `b_use`, which stands for building use, and
    click on `Add`.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-by-attribute.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

As a result, you will see that the buildings are now filled with
different colors based on their use. You can further customize the
colors by clicking on the color ramp and selecting a different one.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-by-attribute-result.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true" title="b_temp? b_phase"}

These field names are pretty cryptic. This is often the case with public data. If you want to learn more about this data, navigate over to the feature layer'

:::

### Adjust layer transparency based on attribute

Finally, let's say we wanted to adjust the transparency of cycleways
based on the max speed allowed on each bike path. We can do that by
changing the style of the `osm_cycleways` layer.

-   Click on the layer `osm_cycleways` to open its properties panel.
-   On the panel `Symbology`, click on `Edit layer style`.
-   Look for the `② Pick a style` option and select `Style options`.
-   Open the panel `Transparency by attribute` and switch the toggle to
    set the transparency based on attribute values.
-   Select the attribute `maxspeed`.

As a result, you will see that the bike paths are now more transparent
for higher speed limits and less transparent for lower speed limits.

To increase the visibility of the bike paths, we can increase the width
of the lines by editing the `Width` slider on the `Symbol style` panel.
We selected 3.75 px for this example.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-transparency-by-attribute.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

Here is the final result of our symbology adjustments:

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/symbology-final-result.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

### Select a better basemap

After adding the layers and customizing their symbology, we have a good,
almost ready map. However, the current basemap (Topographic) is a bit
too busy and makes it hard to see the features we added. Let's change it
to a simpler basemap using the `Basemap` option in the left menu bar.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/basemap-menu-location.png){width="40%"
fig-align="center"}

From the basemap gallery, we can select a simpler basemap. For this
example, we selected the `Light Gray Canvas` basemap, which provides a
clean background that makes our features stand out.

![](images/Workshop1/Step2/basemap-light-gray-canvas.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

**Don't forget to save your map after making these changes!**

## Step 3: Annotate the map

In addition to bringing external sources of information into a map
(whether in the form of a basemap or additional feature layers), it is
common to want to add new information. In many cases it is better to
think of the new information as data, and to store it in its own feature
layer. We will be describing this approach in the next workshop. For our
purposes here, though, we will take the more straightforward approach of
simply drawing on the map. The hand-drawn features will appear in what
ArcGIS Online calls a "sketch layer."

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-sketch-layer-menu.png){width="40%"
fig-align="center"}

After adding the sketch layer to your workspace, a new menu will appear
in the right column with drawing tools and configuration options.

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-sketch-bar-menu.png){width="40%" fig-align="center"}

### Drawing points in a sketch layer

-   Draw points where you were in a (near-)accident on a bike path,
    either as bicyclist of pedestrian.

Zoom in to the location and add a point with the point drawing tool. You
can customize the symbol, size, and color of the point in the sketch
layer menu before adding it to the map. Put as many points as you like.

In our example, we add the following settings to the point symbol:

-   Size: 48 px
-   Vector marker (background): Blue (#2132cf)

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-point-vector.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

### Challenge: Drawing lines and circles in a sketch layer

-   Draw a line where you think there should be a bike path but isn't.

From the sketch layer menu, select the line drawing tool. Click on the
map to start drawing the line, and click again to add vertices.
Double-click to finish the line.

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-line-vector.gif){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

You can customize the line symbol in the sketch layer menu before adding
it to the map. In our example, we add the following settings to the line
symbol:

-   Width: 5 px
-   Dotted line pattern
-   Color: Light blue (#00c8ff)

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-line-style.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

-   Draw a circle where you think there should be a bike parking lot but
    isn't.

Similarly to the line drawing tool, select the circle drawing tool from
the sketch layer menu. Click on the map to draw the circle, and click on
the select tool to finish the shape. You can also customize the symbol
after drawing it by selecting it and changing its properties in the
sketch layer menu. In our example, we add the following settings to the
circle symbol:

-   Fill color: Red (#d13434)
-   Fill transparency: 38%

![](images/Workshop1/Step3/drawing-circle-vector.gif){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

-   Rename the Sketch layer to "Annotations"

Finally, let's rename the sketch layer to "Annotations" to better
reflect its purpose. Click on the three dots next to the sketch layer
and select `Rename`. Enter the new name and click `OK`.

**Save your map after making these changes**

## Step 4: Prepare the map for publication

Almost there! At this point you're ready to start packaging your map for
publication.

### Fine tune symbols

Some of the bike racks are too close together. For point data, we have
the option of using 'proportional symbols' or 'clustered symbols' to
solve this visual clutter.

**To do**: Instructions for using clustered symbols for the bike racks
layer to reduce visual clutter.

To do that, you need to look for the `Print` option in the left menu
bar.

![](images/Workshop1/Step4/export-print-menu.png){width="40%"
fig-align="center"}

For exporting the map you have two options:

-   Layout: This option allows you to create a more complex layout with
    additional map elements such as title, legend, scale bar, north
    arrow, etc. You can choose from several pre-defined templates or
    create your own custom layout.
-   Map only: With this option, you can export just the map itself
    without any additional elements. You can choose the file format
    (PNG, PDF, etc.) and the resolution of the exported map.

For our purposes, we will select the `Layout` option to create a more
complete map for publication.

In the layout menu, you can change the title of the map, select a
`Template` (which is basically a standard page size and orientation),
and select the `File format` for the export (e.g., PNG, PDF).

You can also customize more the layout by enabling the `Advance options`
panel. You can set the scale, add an author name, include copyright
information, increase or decrease the resolution, indicate the [output
spatial
reference](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/using-spatial-references/){target="_blank"},
and select to include legend, north arrow, and scale bar.

Adjust the zoom and position of the map in the preview window to ensure
everything is visible and well-framed.

![](images/Workshop1/Step4/export-layout-menu.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

## Step 5: Share your map

When you're satisfied with the layout and settings, click on the
`Export` button to generate the map. Depending on the selected file
format and resolution, it may take a few moments to process the export.

The result will be list on the `Exports` panel, where you can save the
file to your computer by clicking on the three dots next to the export
and selecting `Save as`.

![](images/Workshop1/Step4/export-save-as.png){width="40%"
fig-align="center"}

This will save the exported map to you ArcGIS Online content. You can
access it later from the `Content` menu in the top menu bar. The new
item will be available as an Image file that you can download to your
computer.

![](images/Workshop1/Step4/export-download-image.png){width="90%"
fig-align="center"}

**NOTE**: Public sharing is a little more complicated, it requires to
set public permissions to all layers used in the map before sharing the
map publicly.

## Other appoaches

There are many ways of making a simple map. Here are some alternative
approaches.

-   By screen grabbing: Create a base layer by screen grabbing a source
    map displayed in a web browser window (e.g., Google Maps). Then,
    using a drawing tool (a dedicated drawing tool such as Adobe
    Illustrator, or any program that provides drawing tools such as
    Microsoft PowerPoint), import the screen grab and draw on top of
    that. \[The following is probably too detailed...\] It is possible
    to capture the base layer at higher-than-screen resolution by
    zooming in, panning and screen grabbing it in pieces, and merging
    the pieces using a tool like Adobe Photoshop. And by measuring
    distances between known points, and/or carefully keeping track of
    scale, it is possible to accurately position figures and
    annotations.

-   Google Earth

-   MapBox

-   OpenStreetMaps

-   [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com) comes with a variety of base layers,
    including multiple types of topographic maps, and it provides a
    number of drawing and annotation tools. Certain features may require
    a subscription.

## From Map to Analysis

The Goal of this workshop series is to provide a gentle introduction to creating maps and conducting geosptial analysis
without the need to have programming skills.

We have organized this curriculum in three workshops:


## I want to make a map

2-hour workshop using ArcGIS Online to create a map. This workshop will introduce the basic elements of a map and
leverage ArcGIS online to learn how to:

- add basemap
- draw line an polygons on a map
- add an existing layer to a map
- change symbology 

Ends with data vs. maps and Sketch Layer vs. Feature Layer (in ArcGIS)


## I think I need GIS

2-3 hours workshop using ArcGIS online to conduct basic GIS data manipulations.

- data import & export
- projections
- raster and vector data

Ends with an analysis, maybe zonal statistics?


## Geospatial Analysis

4-hour workshop. Carpentry-like in ArcGIS Pro or potentially QGIS

Data analysis centric: 

- buffering
- interpolation
- zonal statistics
- raster calculation

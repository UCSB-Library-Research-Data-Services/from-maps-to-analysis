    "text": "The goal of this lesson is to demonstrate how to make a simple map, suitable for inclusion in a publication, using ArcGIS Online. We will follow a typical workflow of: 1 Starting with a basemap, 1 add feature layers from the UCSB campus, 1 draw annotations on top of the map, 1 preparing the map for presentation and exporting it. As an exercise, you will be creating a map that reflects your personal experience biking on the UCSB campus.\nWe will end up with a map something like this: # UCSB bike infrastructure map\nPreliminary: Add an image of the final map here\nAs we will discuss at the end of this lesson, there are many ways of making such a map without using a GIS tool. In fact, in many cases GIS is overkill, both because most of the features GIS tools provide will not be used and because the GIS interface can be cumbersome. But an advantage of GIS is that it opens up the possibility of treating map elements as data, and that in turn opens up and provides an introduction to the world of spatial analysis."

The goal here is to create a map of the bike infrastructure on campus (bike lanes and line, bike racks as points, buildings as polygons) and to then annotate on top of that some of your personal experience as a bicyclist or pedestrian on campus.\nStart by opening a new map in the Map Viewer.\n\n\nImport lines layer (bike paths)\nFrom the Layers panel, click on the add layer button. Search ‘Your organization’ for ‘UCSB OSM Paths’. There should be only one result.\n\n\n\nAdding a layer\n\n\n\nI think we should pause here to discuss properties. *\n\n\n\n\nDrop down menu to My Groups\n\n\nLook for the feature layer osm_cycleways and click on the + Add button to add it to your map.\n\n\n\nAdd UCSB cycleways layer\n\n\n\n\nImport points layer (bike racks)\nRepeat the above steps to add the feature layer bike_racks_ucsb to your map.\n\n\n\nAdd UCSB bike racks layer\n\n\n\n\nImport polygon layer (buildings)\nNow look for the feature layer UCSB Campus Buildings and add it to your map.\n\n\n\nAdd UCSB buildings layer\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the underlying data\nOne advantage of those feature layers is that there is often data associated with it. For example, if you click on the three dots on the right of a feature layer you can access their attribute table using “Show table”.\n\n\n\nattibute table of UCSB buildings layer\n\n\nWe will see later how you can leverage those attributes to set the symbology of a layer according to categories or quantities provided by the attribute table. You can also compute new attributes either based on other attributes or geopatial information. However this will be for our second workshop.\n\n\nSave your map\nNow that you have added the layers to your map, save it by looking for the folder icon in the left menu bar and then selecting the Save as option.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn there, you can add a title, tags, and a short description of your map.\n\naside * Next to your campus profile, is a “tic tac toe” menu with a drop-down menu of the Esri Apps.

    "text": "Step 2: Customize symbology & transparency\nAfter adding our three layers, we have some work to do to make the map more readable. First, let’s adjust the symbology of the bike racks layer to reduce its size and change its symbol to a bike icon.\n\nClick on the layer bike_racks_ucsb to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ② Pick a style option and select Style options.\nClick on the pencil icon next to Symbol style to open the symbol selector.\n\nThere, we have multiple options to customize the symbol. Let’s click on the current symbol chevron to open the full symbol gallery.\nFrom the menu, we can select several categories of symbols. Let’s select the Government category and look for a bike parking icon. Click on the Done button to apply the changes and return to the symbol style panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the size of the symbol, we can use the Size slider to reduce it to a more appropriate size. First, select “Adjust size automatically” to ensure the symbols to scale as you zoom in and out of the map. Then, you can use a custom size by moving the slider or entering a value; in our case, we selected 5.68 px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSize slider quirk\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ArcGIS Online, every time you select the “Adjust size automatically” option, it will reset the size slider to a default value. So make sure to select your desired size after enabling that option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust style based on attribute\nNow, what if we wanted to adjust the symbology based on an attribute? Let’s say we wanted to fill each building with a different color based on its use (academic, residential, administrative, etc.). We can do that by changing the style of the UCSB Campus Buildings layer.\n\nClick on the layer UCSB Campus Buildings to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ① Choose attributes option and select + Field.\nSelect the attribute b_use, which stands for building use, and click on Add.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, you will see that the buildings are now filled with different colors based on their use. You can further customize the colors by clicking on the color ramp and selecting a different one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust layer transparency based on attribute\nFinally, let’s say we wanted to adjust the transparency of cycleways based on the max speed allowed on each bike path. We can do that by changing the style of the osm_cycleways layer.\n\nClick on the layer osm_cycleways to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ② Pick a style option and select Style options.\nOpen the panel Transparency by attribute and switch the toggle to set the transparency based on attribute values.\nSelect the attribute maxspeed.\n\nAs a result, you will see that the bike paths are now more transparent for higher speed limits and less transparent for lower speed limits.\nTo increase the visibility of the bike paths, we can increase the width of the lines by editing the Width slider on the Symbol style panel. We selected 3.75 px for this example.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the final result of our symbology adjustments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a better basemap\nAfter adding the layers and customizing their symbology, we have a good, almost ready map. However, the current basemap (Topographic) is a bit too busy and makes it hard to see the features we added. Let’s change it to a simpler basemap using the Basemap option in the left menu bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the basemap gallery, we can select a simpler basemap. For this example, we selected the Light Gray Canvas basemap, which provides a clean background that makes our features stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your map after making these changes!"

    "text": "Step 3: Annotate the map\nIn addition to bringing external sources of information into a map (whether in the form of a basemap or additional feature layers), it is common to want to add new information. In many cases it is better to think of the new information as data, and to store it in its own feature layer. We will be describing this approach in the next workshop. For our purposes here, though, we will take the more straightforward approach of simply drawing on the map. The hand-drawn features will appear in what ArcGIS Online calls a “sketch layer.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding the sketch layer to your workspace, a new menu will appear in the right column with drawing tools and configuration options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw points where you were in a (near-)accident on a bike path, either as bicyclist of pedestrian.\n\nZoom in to the location and add a point with the point drawing tool. You can customize the symbol, size, and color of the point in the sketch layer menu before adding it to the map. Put as many points as you like.\nIn our example, we add the following settings to the point symbol:\n\nSize: 48 px\nVector marker (background): Blue (#2132cf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw a line where you think there should be a bike path but isn’t.\n\nFrom the sketch layer menu, select the line drawing tool. Click on the map to start drawing the line, and click again to add vertices. Double-click to finish the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize the line symbol in the sketch layer menu before adding it to the map. In our example, we add the following settings to the line symbol:\n\nWidth: 5 px\nDotted line pattern\nColor: Light blue (#00c8ff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw a circle where you think there should be a bike parking lot but isn’t.\n\nSimilarly to the line drawing tool, select the circle drawing tool from the sketch layer menu. Click on the map to draw the circle, and click on the select tool to finish the shape. You can also customize the symbol after drawing it by selecting it and changing its properties in the sketch layer menu. In our example, we add the following settings to the circle symbol:\n\nFill color: Red (#d13434)\nFill transparency: 38%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the Sketch layer to “Annotations”\n\nFinally, let’s rename the sketch layer to “Annotations” to better reflect its purpose. Click on the three dots next to the sketch layer and select Rename. Enter the new name and click OK.\nSave your map after making these changes"

Here are some alternative approaches.\n\nBy screen grabbing: Create a base layer by screen grabbing a source map displayed in a web browser window (e.g., Google Maps). Then, using a drawing tool (a dedicated drawing tool such as Adobe Illustrator, or any program that provides drawing tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint), import the screen grab and draw on top of that. [The following is probably too detailed…] It is possible to capture the base layer at higher-than-screen resolution by zooming in, panning and screen grabbing it in pieces, and merging the pieces using a tool like Adobe Photoshop. And by measuring distances between known points, and/or carefully keeping track of scale, it is possible to accurately position figures and annotations.\nGoogle Earth\nMapBox\nOpenStreetMaps\nCalTopo comes with a variety of base layers, including multiple types of topographic maps, and it provides a number of drawing and annotation tools.

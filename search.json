This map cannot be altered and is static. You can move its location, but its features such as roads and buildings (if any) cannot be changed.\nYou can change the basemap in the Map Viewer. Go to “Basemap” in the menu column. These maps have been preselected as appropriate foundational basemaps.\n\nYou can also manually select a feature layer to use as your basemap.\nIt will initially show you “your content” but you can drop down and choose items from other places such as a group or from ucsb. Since you want an authoritative layer to be the basemap, you will want to choose something from the Living Atlas.\n\nLayers in the Living Atlas have been vetted by ESRI and are maintained by organizations. Typically, government entities create and publish items here,such as USGS or NOAA..\nThe bottom example is the National Land Cover Model created and maintained by USGS.\n Make sure you choose a basemap that is easy to follow and is a good reference.Searching for the term “basemap” will also query appropriate maps that can be used for this purpose."

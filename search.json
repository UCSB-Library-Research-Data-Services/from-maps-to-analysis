This is where you can add components to your map. The way to think about a map is that it is made of different layers that are added on top of each others. Each layer add a specific information to your map. In our example, we will have a layer for the bike paths, one for the bike racks, one for the buildings, and so on… The base layer is special and often made of an image (but does not have to be). It is called a ‘basemap’. Here are the main components of your map:\n\nBasemap (background)\nFeature Layers (your own or imported from others)\nSymbology & legend\nSave and open…\n\n\n\nBasemap\nThe goal of a basemap, is to provide some context in terms of location and/or thematic.

There’s a GIS convention for layer ordering that helps ensure all features remain visible:\nLayer Order Convention (top to bottom):\n\nPoints (e.g., bike racks) - should be on top\nLines (e.g., bike paths) - in the middle\n\nPolygons (e.g., buildings) - at the bottom\n\nThis ordering ensures that smaller features aren’t hidden beneath larger polygon areas.\nFor our map, the recommended order from top to bottom should be:\n\nbike_racks_ucsb (top)\nUCSB OSM Paths (middle)\nUCSB Campus Buildings (bottom)\n\nTo reorder the layers, click and hold on a layer name in the Layers panel, drag it to the desired position, and release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Reorder feature layers\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the underlying data\nFeature layers are driven by data. Each point, line, or polygon has associated with it a row in an attribute table providing information on that specific record.\nFor example, if you click on the three dots on the right of a feature layer you can access their attribute table by selecting Show table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Attribute table of UCSB buildings layer\n\n\n\nWe will see later how you can leverage these attributes to set the symbology of a layer according to categories or quantities provided by the attribute table. You can also compute new attributes either based on other attributes or geospatial information. However this will be for our second workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSave early.

First, let’s adjust the symbology of the bike racks layer to reduce its size and change its symbol to a bike icon.\n\nClick on the layer bike_racks_ucsb to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ② Pick a style option and select Style options.\nClick on the pencil icon next to Symbol style to open the symbol selector.\n\nThere, we have multiple options to customize the symbol. Let’s click on the current symbol chevron to open the full symbol gallery.\nFrom the menu, we can select several categories of symbols. Let’s select the Government category and look for a bike parking icon. Click on the Done button to apply the changes and return to the symbol style panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Selecting a bike parking symbol from the Government category\n\n\n\nTo change the size of the symbol, we can use the Size slider to reduce it to a more appropriate size. First, select “Adjust size automatically” to ensure the symbols to scale as you zoom in and out of the map. Then, you can use a custom size by moving the slider or entering a value; in our case, we selected 5.68 px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningSize slider quirk\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ArcGIS Online, every time you select the “Adjust size automatically” option, it will reset the size slider to a default value. So make sure to select your desired size after enabling that option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Symbol size settings with adjust size automatically option\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust style based on attribute\nNow, what if we wanted to adjust the symbology based on an attribute? Let’s say we wanted to fill each building with a different color based on its use (academic, residential, administrative, etc.). We can do that by changing the style of the UCSB Campus Buildings layer.\n\nClick on the layer UCSB Campus Buildings to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ① Choose attributes option and select + Field.\nSelect the attribute b_use, which stands for building use, and click on Add.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Adjusting symbology style by attribute\n\n\n\nAs a result, you will see that the buildings are now filled with different colors based on their use. You can further customize the colors by clicking on the color ramp and selecting a different one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Buildings colored by their use category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningb_temp? b_phase\n\n\n\n\n\nThese field names are pretty cryptic. This is often the case with public data. If you want to learn more about this data, navigate over to the feature layer’\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust layer transparency based on attribute\nFinally, let’s say we wanted to adjust the transparency of cycleways based on the max speed allowed on each bike path. We can do that by changing the style of the osm_cycleways layer.\n\nClick on the layer osm_cycleways to open its properties panel.\nOn the panel Symbology, click on Edit layer style.\nLook for the ② Pick a style option and select Style options.\nOpen the panel Transparency by attribute and switch the toggle to set the transparency based on attribute values.\nSelect the attribute maxspeed.\n\nAs a result, you will see that the bike paths are now more transparent for higher speed limits and less transparent for lower speed limits.\nTo increase the visibility of the bike paths, we can increase the width of the lines by editing the Width slider on the Symbol style panel. We selected 3.75 px for this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Setting transparency by maxspeed attribute\n\n\n\nHere is the final result of our symbology adjustments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Map with all symbology adjustments applied\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a better basemap\nAfter adding the layers and customizing their symbology, we have a good, almost ready map. However, the current basemap (Topographic) is a bit too busy and makes it hard to see the features we added. Let’s change it to a simpler basemap using the Basemap option in the left menu bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Basemap option in the left menu bar\n\n\n\nFrom the basemap gallery, we can select a simpler basemap. For this example, we selected the Light Gray Canvas basemap, which provides a clean background that makes our features stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Map with Light Gray Canvas basemap\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your map after making these changes!"

    "text": "Step 3: Annotate the map\nIn addition to bringing external sources of information into a map (whether in the form of a basemap or additional feature layers), it is common to want to add new information. In many cases it is better to think of the new information as data, and to store it in its own feature layer. We will be describing this approach in the next workshop. For our purposes here, though, we will take the more straightforward approach of simply drawing on the map. The hand-drawn features will appear in what ArcGIS Online calls a “sketch layer.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Sketch layer option in the left menu\n\n\n\nAfter adding the sketch layer to your workspace, a new menu will appear in the right column with drawing tools and configuration options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Sketch layer drawing tools menu\n\n\n\n\nDrawing points in a sketch layer\n\nDraw points where you were in a (near-)accident on a bike path, either as bicyclist of pedestrian.\n\nZoom in to the location and add a point with the point drawing tool. You can customize the symbol, size, and color of the point in the sketch layer menu before adding it to the map. Put as many points as you like.\nIn our example, we add the following settings to the point symbol:\n\nSize: 48 px\nVector marker (background): Blue (#2132cf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Point symbol customization settings\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge: Drawing lines and circles in a sketch layer\n\nDraw a line where you think there should be a bike path but isn’t.\n\nFrom the sketch layer menu, select the line drawing tool. Click on the map to start drawing the line, and click again to add vertices. Double-click to finish the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Drawing a line on the map\n\n\n\nYou can customize the line symbol in the sketch layer menu before adding it to the map. In our example, we add the following settings to the line symbol:\n\nWidth: 5 px\nDotted line pattern\nColor: Light blue (#00c8ff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Line symbol customization settings\n\n\n\n\nDraw a circle where you think there should be a bike parking lot but isn’t.\n\nSimilarly to the line drawing tool, select the circle drawing tool from the sketch layer menu. Click on the map to draw the circle, and click on the select tool to finish the shape. You can also customize the symbol after drawing it by selecting it and changing its properties in the sketch layer menu. In our example, we add the following settings to the circle symbol. You can type in the values, or interactively select as in the animated figure.\n\nFill color: Red (#d13434)\nFill transparency: 38%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Drawing a circle on the map\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s rename the sketch layer to “Annotations” to better reflect its purpose. Click on the three dots next to the sketch layer and select Rename. Enter the new name and click OK.\nSave your map after making these changes"

Here are some alternative approaches.\n\nBy screen grabbing: Create a base layer by screen grabbing a source map displayed in a web browser window (e.g., Google Maps). Then, using a drawing tool (a dedicated drawing tool such as Adobe Illustrator, or any program that provides drawing tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint), import the screen grab and draw on top of that. [The following is probably too detailed…] It is possible to capture the base layer at higher-than-screen resolution by zooming in, panning and screen grabbing it in pieces, and merging the pieces using a tool like Adobe Photoshop. And by measuring distances between known points, and/or carefully keeping track of scale, it is possible to accurately position figures and annotations.\nGoogle Earth: An in-browser tool that allows you to view and add data layers with high-resolution google imagery. There are some fee based services in Google Earth, and you may need a plan to view some features. Historical satellite imagery is available.\nMapBox: Mapbox has more features available for mobile users. Maps can be viewed and edited on mobile devices.\nOpenStreetMaps: OpenStreetMaps is open source, managed and created by users worldwide. This data can also be downloaded and added to GIS software like ArcGIS Pro or QGIS.\nCalTopo comes with a variety of base layers, including multiple types of topographic maps, and it provides a number of drawing and annotation tools.

## From Map to Analysis

The Goal of this workshop series is to provide a gentle introduction to creating maps and conducting geospatial analysis without the need to have programming skills.

We have organized this curriculum in three workshops:

## Workshop 1 - I want to make a map

2-hour workshop using ArcGIS Online to create a map. This workshop will introduce the basic elements of a map and leverage ArcGIS online to learn how to:

-   add basemap
-   add an existing layer to a map
-   change symbology
-   draw lines and polygons on a map

Ends with data vs. maps aka Sketch Layer vs. Feature Layer

## Workshop 2 - I think I need GIS

2-3 hours workshop using ArcGIS online to conduct basic GIS data manipulations.

-   data import & export
-   projections
-   raster and vector data

Ends with an analysis, maybe zonal statistics?

## Workshop 3 - Geospatial Analysis

4-hour workshop. Carpentry-like in ArcGIS Pro or potentially QGIS

Data analysis centric:

-   buffering
-   interpolation
-   zonal statistics
-   raster calculation

### how - too

## But is a shape data?

-   Add an observation to our [cognitive borders of campus map](https://ucsb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/webeditor/index.html?appid=a5e83ae370d64d528aacb3bf27885d05)
-   See previous observations on [the results map](https://arcg.is/11Ca9n1)

## Features have attributes

-   a data table
-   columns have fixed data types (a lot of them)
-   for example bikes

## Play with symbology & transparency

Based on data `street_pavement`

1. Make a new map
1. Choose a basemap
1. Add layer from Contents --> Groups --> From Maps to Analysis
1. Create filter to show only bikepaths 
1. Join 2 filters together to *OR* sidewalks
1. Save your work!
